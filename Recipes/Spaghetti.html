<h1><Strong>Spaghetti</Strong></h1>
<body>An emblem of Italian cuisine, spaghetti is frequently served with tomato sauce, which may contain various herbs (especially oregano and basil), olive oil, meat, or vegetables. Other spaghetti preparations include amatriciana or carbonara. Grated hard cheeses, such as pecorino romano, Parmesan and Grana Padano, are often sprinkled on top.
    <h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti noodles:</strong>You can use any pasta shape you love. To cook spaghetti, check the package directions. The box should have an approximate cooking time listed. Set a timer 1 to 2 minutes less than the suggested cooking time, and check your spaghetti. I often find that pasta is perfectly al dente before the recommended cooking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Ground meat:</strong>Really any ground meat will work in this recipe. Ground turkey and chicken are usually a bit leaner, while ground beef and pork will have more fat. Use what you have and love.</li>
        <li><Strong>Tomatoes and tomato paste:</Strong>These make the base of our spaghetti sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong></li>
        <li><Strong>Garlic</Strong></li>
        <li><strong>Spices</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven).</li>
        <li>Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat into smaller crumbles as the meat cooks.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once in a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook uncovered for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for seasoning suggestions).</li>
        <li>About 15 minutes before the spaghetti sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Then, cook the pasta according to the package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta and leave for a minute so that it absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with grated parmesan cheese on top.</li>
    </ol>
